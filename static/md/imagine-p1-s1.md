## Motivation {class="align-left"}

---

If I am honoust, nothing had me more excited about the prospect of working for imagine insurance. Since I had laid my eyes on the job spec, it is definitively the role I desire most. To be very frank software development for me started out as an experiment, that turned into a hobby that turned into a job, a job that I am good at, but I am inherently a problem solver. Angular, React, Nodejs, AWS, Azure etc. These are not what I do, these are only my tools. Just like a carpenter is not a sander, a planer or a varnisher.

## Purpose {class="align-left}

---

From conversations I have inferred that your companies objective is to apply state of the art technology to complex problems and to revolutionize an industry that is averse to change. If this is the attitude of management, this is where I want to be, and given this remain the status quo, this is where I will be for a long time.

## Checking my understanding

---

The objective is to to change the way a normal person acquires insurance policies. Applying new ways of thinking and the emergence of Machine Learning, IA and cloud technology, consumers will only be presented with insurance options they need. Not what a broker can convince them to acquire. These options will be determined by an expert system developed by Imagine Insurance, thereby eliminating the commissions of a broker indoctrinated to push products onto the consumer and not to consider the their best interest.
