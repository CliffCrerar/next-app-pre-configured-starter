>  I, Clifford Crerar hereby swear that what is encapsulated in this document is from experience as a architect, technologist and dev. Together with knowledge gained by academic studies and a appetite to know and understand technology and practices associated with the field. I did not compose this document by googling what is a CTO, albeit google in the past has assisted me by means of other developers past experience to solve problems, like a lawyer would read case studies to build a case.

>
>  - by answering questions on Quora, 
>
>  - by Reading and referring to technical documentation like on [Angular.io](www.angular.io), [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) and [RXJS](rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com) to learn how to use new tools and functionalities about the framworks I use.

>  This is where my skills, knowledge and much of my experience comes from before I work my 8 to nth hour day as a software developer. I also hope this gives you a good idea about my work ethic and dedication to adding value to a company that values my participation. Give me a purpose and I will make you famous.
