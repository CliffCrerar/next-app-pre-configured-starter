# Introduction

---

Herein I have encapsulated an outline of how I would go about carrying the burden that comes along with the role, and it scared me a little. Following our meeting, I started asking myself, Cliff if you get this, would you even know what to do? On my credentials I try to be as transparent as possible. I don't think I would have received the invitation likely, I was so caught up with code tests the days leading up to the meeting, I by my own admission was ill prepared. { class="caps-start"}

Up until then, my interviews were for a *developer / writer of code / creator of software*. In these encounters, I get peppered with questions on *theory, practice and process, advantages of this, what decision to make when that*, that week my evenings were senior level code tests, my day spent practicing code. When I arrived I was very much in a mode. I only afterward I realized that this meeting was not run of the mill, not even close. You wanted me to sell you on why I should be the CTO of your company. I apologize for only realising it after the fact.

Believe it or not, I associated more with you than many in my field, most of whom do things the way its always been done, comfortably. I find it extremely uncomfortable when things are comfortable. Feeling this means I am not pushing the boundaries. Stagnation is my enemy. The way you spoke about how you wish to operate was inspiring.

#### Before I developed software

I was a consultant once, for a long time, before I became a student of tech. I used be articulate, these days not so much anymore. I find I express myself better in writing than in speech. Recent years my thoughts translated into features of an application. Before I presented it in a boardrooms. Only a bump in the road, exposure to the right environment will swiftly resolve this. In contrast, I have always been a man of action, I am not a good talker. What I can do is what will impress, not what I can say I can do.

So this is my manifesto, my attempt to sell you on why you should pick me for the job. I apologise in advance if it is incredibly boring. May I only ask one favour of you, I had taken the time to create this just for you (Josh Kaplan), the favour is to please do me the courtesy to read it.
