That responsibility is to not only be able, but enabled to solve any problem that I could possibly be faced with, and in my opinion there is but one way to do this. To ensure that I am constantly in a humble state of learning everyday, learning from everyone, junior and senior, chairman and cleaner.\n\nJustly so as the CTO I will conduct myself as bearer of the responsibility. The following sections is a definition of this responsibility according to the knowledge and expereince.\n\n---\n\n<div>                \n<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://cdn-cloudflare.ga/assets/flat-img-gif/1544094121_web-maint-1.jpg\" alt=\"the setup\"/>\n</div>\n\n---\n\n\n## Matter of strategy {class=\"align-left\"}\n\n---\n\nMy point of departure will be to gain a comprehension of:\n\n{class=\"ul\"}\n- the main drivers of revenue.\n- the vision and strategic objectives of the company and its directors.\n- who the current / potential customers are, target market and market share.\n- the environment the company will operate in external and internal.\n- the existing third party tech / data.\n- what are the key performance indicators that would determine the success. (Obviously the bottom line, but what else)\\\n\n---\n\n<div>\n<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/rocket-space-flat-3d.gif\" alt=\"rocket light speed\">\n</div>\n\n---\n\n> I will mention AWS when referring to cloud services. However; these services are cloud provider agnostic.\n\n## Determine objectives {class=\"align-left\"}\n\n---\n\nFollowing this, after the direction and values are well understood, considering the position of the business I will then write a mission statement. From it, I will derive a strategic objective, or objectives as an executive. Subsequently tactical objectives will be derived for daily / weekly tasks. It will serve as milestones and indicators of the success, while inline with management's expectation. Determinants of the formulation hereof will also depend on the frequency of management's performance reviews.\n\n> **Note:** what I describe here might not be immediately relevant since the company is a startup but will be an inevitability as the company grows.\n\nThese objectives, depending on the delegation of authority, will encapsulate:\n\n- Business infrastructure.\n- Operational Readiness and Technology policies.\n- Software engineering and development operations.\n- The role of technology and social media related to the marketing strategy.\n- Support to customers / employees.\n- Disaster recovery.\n\nEach one of the above will require exploration of the known and unknown to determine optimial execution.\n\n---\n\n<div>\n<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/up-in-space.gif\" alt=\"up in space\">\n</div>\n\n","p3-s1":"# Business infrastructure \n\n---\n\nAlthough a fully cloud based solution is well within the realms of possibility there is still a a degree of physical hardware required, minimally productivity devices (laptops or desktops) and a connection to the internet. Decisions, for on premise infrastructure and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) will be based on access, nature of operations, place of business and the services included in the lease agreement of office space.\n\n---\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/evpE9T3nXxw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n---\n\n> [Cloud Info Media](/info-media) is a \"mixed tape\" for my favorite AWS videos, I added it as a nice to have.

(Static IP's are required for hosting online assets like websites / applications etc.)\n- As you will see in the cloud architecture diagram above, the VPC (Virtual private cloud network) is divided up into subnets. Subnets seperates the publicly accessed network from the intranet, in this example, employee access a stricter governed subnet that is seperate, albeit connected, the access to the \"internal subnet\" will be stricter than the access to the public subnet.\n- The cloud architecture diagram has support in its own subnet, to seperate all the concerns, subnets generally available at additional cost.\n- For productivity users will access [worspaces](#workspaces) as Desktop as as service (DaaS) located behind a security group and accessed via [single sign (SSO)](#singe-sign-on) on credentials provided via a cloud directory service.\n- Access to any virtual servers can be restricted per IP address, these are mere IP filters. For AWS EC2 servers can only be accessed if you have a security key (asymetric encryption). Google is much more relaxed on this front. As for Azure I have only used serverless in that cloud.\n\n{class=\"rn-list\"}\n\n---\n\n<div>\n\t<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/banner.png\" alt=\"networking banner\">  \n</div>\n\n---\n\n## Operations and policies {class=\"align-left\"}\n\n---\n\nAs the business grows various roles will be established, employees almost at all levels require access to proctivity applications which are usually at least Microsoft's products like word, excel and powerpoint. Although there are other, arguably better options available; Microsoft productivity applications are an institution. \n\nExpecting employees to use alternatives could have an impact on morale. In my experience the most effective plug for this gap would be to acquire a office 365 license per employee thereby access to the desired productivity applications by default, and cloud space. That being said, desktop as a service could  resolve this problem.\n\nPolicies would typically be related to acceptable use and the protection of the firms intellectual property. \n\n## The role of technology and social media related to marketing strategy.\n\n---\n\nThis mainly involves the companie's strategic position in terms of social media, and because the company will start with minimal staff, I can volunteer in this area. The idea is not so much about selling as it is about awareness and a strong presence online. That being said, very much a role involving colaboration with sales. \n\nSetting up the correct social media pages, registering the business with the right portals, like google business, linkedIn companies etc. Publishing information sites, email campaigns and the right tech for the job, conducting webinars, availing all kinds of online content. \n\nPublishing privacy policies, terms of use, disclaimers. Implementing controls to receive notifications when someone mentions the company. Managing the companie's reputation online. Applying search engine optimisation and automating social media posts to increase **SEO**. Analysing the results of campaigns to launch more effective campaigns. \n\nAttempt to get users attention by the possibility of an incentive, so to drop cookies in the right place.  User profiling to better understand the target market. Finding software to manage all of this centrally, (A package I know of named Pardot is extremely effective, also has a hefty price tag.)\n\n# Support \n\n---\n\nFrom a perspective of Chief Technology Officer there are two distinct groups of user that will require support. The **consumer** of the product / software and the **employees** of the business. The support required here will have different objectives that must be considered.\n\n---\n\n\n\n<div>\n\t<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/tech-support.jpg\" alt=\"tech-support\">  \n</div>\n\n## Employee\n\n---\n\nDid you turn it off and on? The days it being the fix for everything are long gone, still an effective solution to many device problems (Joking aside). Users are become smarter, users that work in offices are by default knowledge workers, often can troubleshoot their own problems. That being said I worked in dev teams, so maybe not a fair assumption. But still as long as offices are at a single premise and employee count less than twenty, it will be a one man show.\n\n## Customers / Users \n\n---\n\nThis however may definitly not be a one man show, but it will be a show of user support automation. Cloud services offer [Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS)](#Machine-learning-powering-business). Machines already having some degree of training. I pick up where the cloud developers left off and teach it to handle and resolve user queries. Queries it can't resolve are forwarded to me, once resolved, the support bot receives some training and in future should be able to resolve a similar case on its own. The nature of ML is also an evolution. The more queries it handles the faster it learns. \n\nIt will require a ticketing system to integrate with the support bot and carefully monitored to determine the effectiveness and efficiency. This also very much in the realm of possibility. An example of such a system currently is [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/dr/sponsor-biz?utm_source=google&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=2047452426&utm_term=intercom&utm_ad_collection=79229079744&_bt=385151934172&_bg=79229079744&utm_ad=385151934172&offer=sponsoredbybiz&utm_campaign_name=go_evg_acq_trial_b-a-rlsa_generic_bld_row_en&utm_ad_collection_name=gen-p_intercom&utm_ad_name=sponsoredbybiz_text_20q3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwoqDtBRD-ARIsAL4pviBLYAVRsYpQrRaJvrb-A06L7gEE98NohktV9dVlY07_GQsh_cKCjg0aAm0REALw_wcB).\n\n# Disaster Recovery\n\n---\n\nIt is difficult to say not knowing what the technology stack would be. Reliance on mainly Iaas and PaaS makes it very easy to implement and automate efficiently while eliminating a considerable amount of risk in the process. \n\nUser desktops will be templates and from my experience will only be disrupted by a break in connection to the internet. Using cloud directory services along with single sign on means that users will have one set of credentials to access everything, adding two factor authentication to the mix means that if a troll acquires credentials it is worthless if he does not have access to a users smart device. Furthermore, workspaces can be supplemented by workdocs. \n\nThis is agreat solution because it uses storage that is version aware, unlike windows NTFS file system from windows and HPFS on a Mac. Cloud storage block allows you to see what was in your excel spreadsheet last week, last month, last year. To setup disaster recovery is as easy as buying ice-cream.\n\nI will not elaborate further on this topic as it only becomes a serious discussion for on premise hardware and file storage.","p4-s1":"#  Software engineering\n\n---\n\nThis will be the most definite and prominent responsibility, In summary it will involve translating requirements into a usable product. Key success factors will be the interpretation of requirements, designing the system architecture resulting in a system document. Delegating to a development team and to determine the most approprate approach to the solution in collaboration with management, whether outsourced or in-house, what technologies to use, while taking a preemptive approach to the resolution of unforeseen obstacles. A intensive requirements gathering phase will assist in reducing the risk of the unknown.\n\n---\n\n<div>\n\t<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/coding.gif\" alt=\"coding\">  \n</div>\n\n---\n\n> It is almost a certainty that the architecture and specification will undergo considerable updates during the implementation, even during the pilot and maintenance phase. The ability to adapt to change during these phases will impact the timeline and to time to market.\n\nA RAD (rapid applications development) approach would be my choice and the method of execution would be Agile. Using cloud technology wherever possible as there are [many developer aids ](Building-Applications) provided as a cloud service.\n\n## Requirements gathering\n\n---\n\nThe main focus with requirements gathering phase is in essence to list all the user stories. User stories  usually begins something like **\"when I do *something*, then *something* else must happen\"**. \n\nThe first tricky is to interpret the requirements, but considering the underlying need as opposed to just doing what is asked for, indeed what is asked for must be what is delivered, however consider the following analogy. In 1899 if you asked poeple that were part of the industrial revolution what they wanted, they would have said \"faster horses\", but what they needed was a car.\n\nThe second tricky part, and the part where management and development contend on quite a bit, is to define the **minimum viable product** \n\n## Minimum Viable Product\n\n---\n\nVersion 1, what important features of the systems will be included in the first release and which of the features will be added later. Discussions around *MVP* also serve to sensitise management on the moving parts of the system that are transparent to the user but cannot be neglected, especially if the system is to be used by consumers at large.\n\n---\n\n<div>\n\t<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/brainstorming.jpg\" alt=\"brainstorming\">  \n</div>\n\n## System document\n\n---\n\nVery inappropriately named, the system document is more of a library than a document. The library describes the system in as much detail as necessary. A balance must be maintained per the [agile manifesto ](https://agilemanifesto.org/) *\"functional code as opposed to documentation\"*. \n\nIt will encompass of the requirements of the system, what options are available to most efficiently implement the system. For example, is there a product that can be bought from \"the shelf\" that will fit the needs, is there a shelf product that we can modify, does the system require to be developed from scratch.\n\nIt will cover viability, feasibility and return on investment (although I have a strong suspicion that this has been done already, otherwise you would not be talking to me.). \n\nIt makes reference to the technology stack that sets the platform and boundaries the the application runs in, which for modern web application mean cross-platform and progressive.\n\nIt will hold the architectural framework normally completed using Unified Modelling Language (UML) which is a standard practice for creating a blueprint of the application.\n\nJust like a blueprint for a building informs the builder to complete the construction; where the columns must go and the load bearing structures. So does a components diagram, just as the name says lays out the components of the system. A sequence diagram shows how the user interactions with the system and how the system components interact with each other to fulfill the user's instruction. An Entity Relation Diagram defines the structure of the database, it lays out the tables of the database, how the tables are related and what the columns must be.\n\nThis part will very much be the architecture of the document. I mentioned before that the document or library will be constantly evolving, the architecture if done right will stand firm, Architecture is that part that should not change much throughout an applications lifecycle, although the app may change dramatically the manner in which it was designed will not. If it has to change drastically, it is an indication of weak architecture.\n\nThe above only describes some of the content that must go in a system document. It is not a once of documentation, it is a document or library that is not only completed by one person but all who are involved in the development of a system.\n\nAs a developer getting caught up in documentation is time spent that could have been spent completing a feature or fixing a bug, and that is a very reasonable argument. With modern development tools the process of documenting the application while it is under development can be automated all a developer must to do is comment his code appropriately, which is also a very reasonable expectation, and a bot will handle the rest. \n\nThe only documentation that will be completed outside of a coding environment is the architectural designs and the application wire-frames.\n\n## Wire-frames\n\n---\n\nWhen a designer draws out art boards that visually describes the User interface. These act as non-functional prototypes and also serve to test whether the requirements have been interpreted correctly. This is where most of the non-functional testing takes place, where the interpretation of requirements are evaluated. Doing wire-framing also saves time, because designing and interface that is functional, placing it before the user or management then to find out it is not what they where exprecting means a los of time becuase the code modules that control the features must also be refactored. Having management and user confortable with the look and feel before functional implementation saves back and forth changing things that work that could in some instances possibly destabilise the application. This must be avoided as far as possible.\n\n---\n\n<div>\n<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/design-page-flat.png\" alt=\"wireframing\"/>  \n</div>\n\n---\n\nHere my priority will also be to ensure that appropriate UX design principles are followed and is designed for a great user experience, while at the same time ensuring the application conforms with the modern web. (At the moment the main trend in interface design is called \"Material Design\").\n\n> #### MATERIAL DESIGN\n>\n> These are principles published by google in 2017 that describe how a user interface must be layed out, what colors to use to make user interfaces beautiful, enjoyable, functional and responsive. This is what the modern web has turned into since the publication.\n\n## Cross-platform\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion *Cross-platform* means building one application that runs on a Windows PC, a MAC, a Samsung Smart Phone an iPhone and a tablet. It is also a web application accessed through the browser as well as a desktop application that can be downloaded to a Windows PC or a MAC and runs like a native application on a mobile phone. It is not an impossible task.\n\nThis is why designing and implementation of a modern application is done according to the Model View Controller Architecture.\n\n---\n\n<div>\n\t<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/cross-platform.png\" alt=\"cross-platform\">  \n</div>\n\n---\n\n**MVC** Architecture separates the user view from the module controller and the data thus making it possible to use the same controller and data for different views, it greatly assist in developing one application for all platforms where only the layout of the user view may be different. Even more so creating a smart layouts and making it responsive and flexible means that one view can be used for display on a desktop as well as a smart phone.\n\n<div>\n<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/responsive-layout.jpg\" alt=\"responsive layout\">  \n</div>\n\n## Agile Methodologies\n\n---\n\nAs opposed to Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) or waterfall, which determines that a rigid plan is followed that would deliver software by a certain deadline and the a development phases strictly following one another, the agile approach focusses on short burst or sprints where the goal is to have a peice of work done within a two week sprint. \n\n<div>\n\t<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/agileteam.jpg\" alt=\"agile team\">  \n</div>\n\n- #### ***Standups***\n\n  Each morning a standup session is conducted lasting no longer than fifteen minutes, everyone states the work from the previous day, the work for today and whether any difficulties might have been encountered. This helps the manager excercise good controll over the team because he is constanly aware of what everyone is doing and if the yare on track or not. \n\n  Stand up is by no means a policing session, it must be a safe space where everyone get a chance to speak and everyone must listen.\n\n- #### ***Sprint planning***\n\n  Every two weeks the sprint is planned, the planned tasks are discussed and assigned. This is preceded by a retrospective session where the good, the bad and the ugly is reflected upon, thereby reducing the the likelyhood of the unknown while celebrating the wins and making the whole team aware of pitfalls.\n\n  <div>\n  \t<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/presenting.png\" alt=\"presenting\">  \n  </div>\n\n- #### ***Sprints***\n\n  The agile development cycle is iterative meaning that all the phases of development, requirements gathering, implementation, testing and deployment is occuring in almost every cycle. However depending on the maturity of the project, some phases will be more prominent than others. For instance at the start of the project more requirements gathering and implementation will be prominent and later on testing and deployment at the same time as requirements gathering and implementation are still ongoing.\n\n  <div>\n\t<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/adlc.png\" alt=\"presenting\">  \n  </div>\n\n  > This is what it means to be agile, the ability to respond and adapt to an ever changing environment.\n\n  ---\n  \n  - ##### **Mixed approach**\n  \n    This will be when a team mixes up the agile approach wit the waterfall approach. Determining the approach will be determined by the requirement, Software projects where failure could cause fatality usually tend to be more waterfall than agile. This is why the development approach for a space shuttle atmosperic reentry telemetry will greatly differ from the approach to develop candy crush.\n\n","p5-s1":"# Development Operations\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, this is defined as governance of the software engineering process while constantly striving to minimise inefficiencies by maximising automation. Every new software development team will have to do things manually, although implementation of automation processes are absolutely crucial, the implementation of automation takes time, time that could be spent developing features. This is something that I am always mindful of because you cannot sell automation, however the implementation of effective automation does reduce the time to releases.\n\n---\n\n<div>\n\t<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/dev-ops.gif\" alt=\"development operation\">  \n</div>\n\n---\n\n## Devtools and Code Review\n\n---\n\nMy eventual goal here will be to use effective devtools (software that aids developers to code faster), and reasonable and flexible code reviews (not all developers write code the same, to penelizing a developer because that is not what I would to is just daft, and wastes time redoing some thing that works just fine.) main focus being that code is coherent as well as cohesive (clean code) as well as appropriatly commented. The main objective the code review that I am describing will be to ensure that documentation can be automated successfully.\n\n<div>\n\t<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/working-it.gif\" alt=\"working it\">  \n</div>\n\nBecause of the agile approach this will be crucial, ensuring that application documentation is updated as the application evolves.\n\nCode reviews and bug reporting must be a blameless process, it does not matter who wrote the code, who made the error. This blameless approach goes a long way to help keep morale high.\n\n## Functional Automated Testing\n\n---\n\nFunctional testing will be the first process that must be automated, automated tests can run while developers are not working, automation does not get tired, does not need a salary nor children that get sick. The reason I say it is so crucial is because I have first hand experience of what happens when a manual testing process fails, and it is almost gaurenteed that there will be oversight.\n\nIn some cases it so happens that the implementation of a new feature on an existing application could break something that was working before, this is unfortunatly inevitable. The two main controls to avoid this is flexible but robust architecture as well as regression testing (retesting everything after a new feature is implemented).  \n\n<div>\n\t<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/man-or-machine.gif\" alt=\"man or machine\">  \n</div>\n\n> If a feature is due last week, a tester cannot afford to complete a manual regression test on a system that already sports a hundred and one features, and if he tries it could take a week. Because of pressure certian tests will be neglected. The last thing that any manager wants to hear from a customer is \"but it was working before, why is it broken now?\". \n\nAutomated tests do not miss or neglect to complete tests, unless the test does not exist. They do not compromise and let some things slide. Automation does the regression testing in minutes.\n\n## Load Testing\n\n---\n\nThese tests have many variables and are difficult to simulate and automate, the up side is that they do not have to be carried out as often as functional testing. Implementing in a scalable cloud environment almost eliminates this risk completely. \n\nThe most effective way to prevent a load failure is not by testing but by monitoring. The same data that will give a marketing exec figures of a target market or consumer demographic, gives a software engineer info to most optimally implement load balancing, data distribution and assists in determining an effective scalability strategy. \n\n### Test Driven Approach\n\n---\n\n- Bug detection usually has two sources; testing and users, bugs are an inevitability. There are varying degrees of bugs in the software. Bugs that are but a minor inconvenience to bugs that cause complete systems failure. Another very effective method of reducing this is by test driven development. Test driven development is where you write the test case for a certain part of the feature first before you implement it, automated testing is usually code that is written and executed by a computational device just like a feature of an application. \n\n- With test driven development, the automated test is actually inegrated into the application. This approach is greatly about opportunity cost. I concede the cost is a feature taking more time to implement (varies on the experience of the dev with TDD and the complexities of the feature), the benefit is that additional time spent developing automation is considerably reduced. Currently in practice this is the most popular approach especially with developers that use object orientation. (Java, C#)\n\n## Releasing\n\n---\n\nWith cloud technology it is not uncommon for releases to occur on a daily basis, the application runs in a central location and not on a user's machine. Consider the following scenario:\n\n> A bug reported by a user at 9am, The case is handled by a support bot and automatically assigned to an appropriate developer. \n>\n> The developer fixes the bug, completes white box testing and once he is satisfied the bug is fixed, pushes his code to a git repository where a bot picks up the update pulls it to a staging area and runs the tests.\n>\n> If all the tests are successful a manager is notified. Depending on how much faith he has in his machines approves it without extensive review, or even lets the machine decide. By and by 1am the bug is fixed and a new version of the application is released. \n\nThis is the current practice. On projects where there are hundreds of developers this almost happens hourly and well within the realms of possibility. In practice it is called **Continues Integration / Continues Delivery or Deployment**.\n\n<div>\n<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/globe-7.gif\" alt=\"blowing it away\">  \n</div>\n\nThere is never really a point in time. An application is constantly evolving on a daily basis, no more lengthy lead times for features to be released. \n\nFor example this very site, If you are reading it the same day I sent it, you could probably encounter some broken sentences, over user of the word \"that\" and all my bad writing habits because I have to self review it. I normally let it cool down and review it again. All my online material follow this CI/CD approach, if you are reading this two or three days after I sent it I might have ironed out all those \"bugs\" already.\t","p6-s1":"# Cloud Information Media\n\n---\n\n> This page was just added as a nice to have, AWS have really short and interesting videos that describe their services.\n\n## AWS Cloud Infra structure\n\n---\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RPis5mbM8c8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

Together with knowledge gained by academic studies and a appetite to know and understand technology and practices associated with the field. I did not compose this document by googling what is a CTO, albeit google in the past has assisted me by means of other developers past experience to solve problems, like a lawyer would read case studies to build a case. \n>\n>  How I keep my skills as sharp is:\n>\n>  - by reading articles from Medium, Hackernoon and Hasnode, \n>\n>  - by answering questions on Quora, \n>\n>  - by Reading and referring to technical documentation like on [Angular.io](www.angular.io), [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) and [RXJS](rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com) to learn how to use new tools and functionalities about the framworks I use.\n>\n>  - by flexing my coding skills on hacker rank,\n>\n>  - and by learning about software engineering, interaction design and software project management\n>\n>  This is where my skills, knowledge and much of my experience comes from before I work my 8 to nth hour day as a software developer. I also hope this gives you a good idea about my work ethic and dedication to adding value to a company that values my participation. Give me a purpose and I will make you famous.\n\n# Conclusions\n\n---\n\nIf you decide to hire me what you can expect is diligence, ethics and integrity, dedication to learning new things and the use of the most modern technology. I will always strive to ensure I understand as well as be commited to ensuring the business gets and keeps the competative advantage and a healthy bottom line.\n\n---\n\n<div>\n\t<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"static/img/coming-for-the-comp.gif\" alt=\"coming for the competition\">  \n</div>\n\n---\n\nSite Author: ***[Clifford Crerar](www.cliff-crerar.tech)*** {style=\"text-align: center\"}\n\n---\n\n\n\n# Technologies used in the production of this site:\n\n---\n\n"}
